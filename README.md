# Placing Anywhere

Mod for The Long Dark that removes restrictions when placing items, and adds controls to rotate and position the object.

## Installing the mod
* If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).
* Download the latest version of PlacingAnywhere.dll from the [releases page](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-placing-anywhere/releases/latest).
* Move PlacingAnywhere.dll into the Mods folder in your TLD install directory.

## Controls
* The game by default rotates objects on the Y axis with the mouse wheel or with Q/E.
* With T/Y you can rotate on X axis, and with G/H on the Z axis.
* B/N offset the object up and down.
* Pressing Shift makes the increments smaller (25%)
* Rotation is applied using the object as refrence, so what direction "forward" is will change if you rotate the object on a different axis.
