# Placing Anywhere

Mod for The Long Dark that removes restrictions when placing items, and adds controls to rotate and position the object.

## Installing the mod
* If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).
* Download the latest version of PlacingAnywhere.dll from the [releases page](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-placing-anywhere/releases/latest).
* Move PlacingAnywhere.dll into the Mods folder in your TLD install directory.

## Controls
* The game by default rotates objects on the Y axis with the mouse wheel.
* When placing an object, holding LeftAlt and moving the mouse allows you to rotate the object in the X and Z axis.
* If the object sinks into the surface or another object, holding the Z key makes it conform to the surface under the cursor.
* Period key makes the object rotate 45 degrees in the Y axis.
* Comma key makes the object rotate 45 degrees in the X axis (useful to put books upright, for example).
