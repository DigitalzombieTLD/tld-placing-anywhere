# Placing Anywhere

Mod for The Long Dark that lifts restrictions when placing items, and adds controls to rotate and position the object.
Compatible with Better PLacing, but also works as standalone.

## Updates
### v1.0
* Initial release

## Controls
* When placing an item, using the mousewheel allows you to rotate the object in the Y axis.
* If holding LeftAlt, moving the mouse allows you to rotate the object in the X and Z axis.
* If the object sinks into the surface, holding the Z key makes it conform to what's under the cursor.
* Period key makes the object rotate 45 degrees in the Y axis.
* Comma key makes the object rotate 45 degrees in the X axis (useful to put books upright, for example).

## Know Issues
* With this mod installed, Better Placing's feature of matching the rotation (R key) of the object below is disabled. Matching position (P key) works if you're not holding the Z key.
