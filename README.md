* Download the latest version of PlacingAnywhere.dll from the [releases page](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-placing-anywhere/releases/latest and place in your Mods folder.

## Default Controls
* The game by default rotates objects on the Y axis with the mouse wheel or with Q/E.
* With T/Y you can rotate on X axis, and with G/H on the Z axis.
* B/N offset the object up and down.
* Pressing Shift makes the increments smaller (25%)
* Rotation is applied using the object as refrence, so what direction "forward" is will change if you rotate the object on a different axis.
* Pressing LeftAlt enables user to rotate object with the mouse
* K resets rotation of the object to make it flat on the surface under the cursor
* Z toggles conform to surface mode
* X toggles snap to object below mode
